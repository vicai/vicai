# vicaimode

vicaimode is a Claude Code skill pack for rigorous engineering work. ai writes too much slop code — throughput without quality is not the goal. if you want to go fast, go deep first. vicaimode helps you write less, but higher quality code.

**vicaimode is a mode.** run `/vicaimode` at the start of a task and it reads your request, picks the matching playbook, and applies rigorous engineering principles to the work.

**vicaimode gives you fearless parallelism.** when you can go deep on one agent and trust it to write good, verifiable code, you can truly parallelize with confidence. start multiple agents up with `/vicaimode` and trust that they'll hold the same bar.

**use any model.** every frontier model has its strengths and weaknesses. vicaimode's multi-model workflows take advantage of each model's unique strengths, and `/setup-vicaimode` maps roles to whatever models you have.

fork it. improve it. make it yours.

## install

vicaimode ships as a plugin inside this repo. add the repo as a plugin marketplace, then install:

```text
/plugin marketplace add vicai/vicai
/plugin install vicaimode@vicai
```

Or use the skills directly by copying (or symlinking) `vicaimode/skills/*` into `.claude/skills/` and `vicaimode/agents/*` into `.claude/agents/`.

## get started

two steps:

1. run [`/setup-vicaimode`](./skills/setup-vicaimode/SKILL.md), pick a reasoning budget, and choose which models you want.
2. use [`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md) whenever you're doing anything that requires rigor.

new here? the [vicaimode guide](./docs/guide/README.md) walks you through a first real task, from setup and prompting through verification and overnight runs.

that's it. the other skills are situational; the mode skill uses them for you as needed. out of the box the mode splits work by model strength: code delegates (feature, refactoring, bug fix, perf, hillclimb) go to grok, while the hardest changes, prose, and judgment go to fable 5.1. the default panel is fable 5.1 / sol / grok / opus 5. [`/setup-vicaimode`](./skills/setup-vicaimode/SKILL.md) changes any of it.

## usage

use [`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task. it reads your request, picks from a set of playbooks, and runs the other skills as the steps need them.

### just use [`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md)

this skill is the main shortcut. i use it whenever i need the agent to do rigorous engineering work. it comes with twenty-three playbooks:

```
/vicaimode this pr has a subtle bug where the scroll drifts every 750ms even when idle. repro
first, then fix and verify.
```

```
/vicaimode i'm going to bed. land the stack even if ci flakes. i want everything merged by
morning.
```

</details>



when invoked it:

1. matches your task to a [playbook](./skills/vicaimode/playbooks/) and opens a todo list whose first items are its steps, copied in verbatim.
2. routes to the other skills as the steps fire.
3. writes unslopped replies framed for the consumer and the maintainer.

the full rules and playbooks live in [`skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md).

[`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md) is also a sticky mode: once entered it stays on across turns, applying itself when a playbook matches or the task needs rigor and staying out of the way otherwise. opt out any time by saying so.

[`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md) works extremely well with Claude Code's `/loop` command. you can make Claude Code work for many hours without sacrificing rigor.

## skills

[`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md) runs most of these for you when a step needs them (`how`, `why`, `architect`, `arena`, `swarm`, `interrogate`, `unslop`, `no-comments`, `technical-writing`, `tdd`, and the principles). the table below is for when you want one directly:

```
/how do we cancel runs? do we have an n+1 when we look up every run to cancel?
```

```
/interrogate review this pr.
```

<summary>all skills</summary>

| skill | use it when |
|---|---|
| [`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md) | default entry point for any non-trivial task. |
| [`/how`](./skills/how/SKILL.md) | you want a walkthrough of how a subsystem works. |
| [`/why`](./skills/why/SKILL.md) | you want to know why something was built this way. discovers available MCPs at run time and queries each evidence category in parallel (source control, issue tracker, long-form docs, real-time chat, infra observability, error tracking, analytics warehouse). |
| [`/recall`](./skills/recall/SKILL.md) | you're starting or resuming work and want your recent context on a topic rebuilt from your own chat history and the shared record, handed back as a tight current-state brief. |
| [`/blast-radius`](./skills/blast-radius/SKILL.md) | you have a small-looking change and want to know what else it could break, with the one fact it's safe because of proven by running code, not asserted. |
| [`/architect`](./skills/architect/SKILL.md) | you're about to write code that crosses a function boundary and want the caller's usage, types, and module shape settled first. |

### examples

mostly i type [`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task and let it route to a playbook. the other skills fire as the steps need them. a few i reach for directly.

## the `vicai-agent` and Comment Sicko subagents

vicaimode also ships a subagent that runs my style end to end. spawn it from a parent agent via [`subagent_type: "vicai-agent"`](./agents/vicai-agent.md). it reads `vicaimode` in full, including its inline principles index, before doing any work. substituting `generalPurpose` skips that read and drifts.

[`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md) and [`subagent_type: "vicai-agent"`](./agents/vicai-agent.md) route through the same wrapper.

vicaimode also ships [Comment Sicko](./agents/comment-sicko.md), a read-only comment reviewer available as `subagent_type: "Comment Sicko"`. usually invoke it through [`/no-comments`](./skills/no-comments/SKILL.md), not directly.

## principles

twenty-three short skills, one principle each. `vicaimode` indexes them inline and reads that index at task start. the standalone files are there so other skills can reference a principle by name, and so the index can point at the full rule for each.

<details>
<summary>all twenty-three principles</summary>

| principle | group | rule |
|---|---|---|
| [laziness-protocol](./skills/principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md) | core | Bias toward deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem. |
| [foundational-thinking](./skills/principle-foundational-thinking/SKILL.md) | core | Apply before writing logic: choosing core types and data structures, sequencing scaffold-vs-feature work, asking what concurrent actors share. Get the data structures right so downstream code becomes obvious. |
| [redesign-from-first-principles](./skills/principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md) | core | Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from day one, instead of bolting it on. |
| [attack-the-premise](./skills/principle-attack-the-premise/SKILL.md) | core | Apply when two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Take a census of which actors hold the imbalance before the next fix, then question the premise instead of writing another fix that assumes it. |
| [subtract-before-you-add](./skills/principle-subtract-before-you-add/SKILL.md) | core | Remove dead weight, redundant validators, and stub references first, then build on the simpler base. |
| [minimize-reader-load](./skills/principle-minimize-reader-load/SKILL.md) | core | Count layers between question and answer, and hidden state in the reader's head; collapse one-caller wrappers and shrink mutable scope. |
| [outcome-oriented-execution](./skills/principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md) | core | Apply during planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture; don't preserve smooth intermediate states with throwaway compatibility code. |
| [experience-first](./skills/principle-experience-first/SKILL.md) | core | Choose user delight over implementation convenience; ship fewer polished features over more rough ones. |
| [exhaust-the-design-space](./skills/principle-exhaust-the-design-space/SKILL.md) | core | Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare side by side before committing. |
| [build-the-lever](./skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) | core | Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun. |
| [model-the-domain](./skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md) | architecture | Encode the domain in a structure instead of scattered conditionals. |
| [boundary-discipline](./skills/principle-boundary-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Concentrate guards at system boundaries (CLI, config, network, external APIs); trust internal types and keep business logic in pure functions. |
| [type-system-discipline](./skills/principle-type-system-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand semantic primitives, parse external data at boundaries, refuse to lie to the compiler, exhaust variants, derive from authoritative schemas. |
| [make-operations-idempotent](./skills/principle-make-operations-idempotent/SKILL.md) | architecture | Converge to the same end state regardless of partial prior runs. |
| [migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis](./skills/principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis/SKILL.md) | architecture | Migrate callers and delete the old API in the same wave instead of preserving compatibility layers. |
| [separate-before-serializing-shared-state](./skills/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/SKILL.md) | architecture | Eliminate the sharing first; serialize structurally only when one shared writer is a real invariant. |
| [prove-it-works](./skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles.'. |
| [fix-root-causes](./skills/principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md) | verification | Trace each symptom to its root cause and fix it there; reproduce first, ask why until you reach it, resist nil-check guards that silence crashes. |
| [sequence-verifiable-units](./skills/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply to multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and to how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a verifiable state, check each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself to a reviewer. |
| [test-behavior-not-implementation](./skills/principle-test-behavior-not-implementation/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply when you write, change, or keep a test. Call the code the way its users do and assert the result they observe against a literal expected value. If the test would still pass when every imported function returns undefined, rewrite the assertion or delete the test. |
| [guard-the-context-window](./skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md) | delegation | Route bulk to subagents; keep summaries in the main thread, not raw payloads. |
| [never-block-on-the-human](./skills/principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md) | delegation | Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct after the fact; reserve confirmation for irreversible actions. |
| [encode-lessons-in-structure](./skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) | meta | Encode the rule as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text. |

## not shipped here

a few things `vicaimode` references but doesn't bundle:

- `/deslop` and the `deslop` skill ship in the `cursor-team-kit` plugin.
- `control-cli` (for CLIs and TUIs) and `control-ui` (for browser, Electron, web) ship in `cursor-team-kit` too.
- `/skill-creator` is a Claude Code built-in. Claude Code also ships a built-in `/babysit`; inside `vicaimode`, the [babysit playbook](./skills/vicaimode/playbooks/babysit.md) supersedes it for pr-status requests.

install `cursor-team-kit` alongside vicaimode if you want the full set.

## why are there no planning skills?

Claude Code already has a great plan mode which works great with vicaimode. but personally, i don't believe in planning. the best spec is code. if you do want to make a plan, [`/vicaimode`](./skills/vicaimode/SKILL.md) covers it, but it's not a default. 

## make it yours

`vicaimode` is my style. you may not want exactly that.

type [`/automate-me`](./skills/automate-me/SKILL.md). it mines your recent transcripts, drafts a `<your-name>-mode` skill from how you've actually worked, and routes through vicaimode underneath. you keep vicaimode as the base and end up with your own routing skill alongside `vicaimode`.

models are configurable too. type [`/setup-vicaimode`](./skills/setup-vicaimode/SKILL.md). it detects the models you have access to and writes a small config file mapping each role (code, judgment, the review panels) to a model. every skill reads it and falls back to sensible defaults when the file is absent, so you override only what you want.

## automations

vicaimode also ships a dormant [benny automation pack](./automations/benny/). benny triages slack issue reports, then reproduces and fixes confirmed bugs with real ui evidence. its files are not registered as slash skills.

to set it up, point Claude Code at [`FOR_AGENTS.md`](./automations/benny/FOR_AGENTS.md). setup copies the pack into the target repository at `.claude/automations/benny/`, enables vicaimode there for shared skills, and keeps user configuration outside the copied pack.
